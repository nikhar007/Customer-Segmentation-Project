# Customer-Segmentation-Project
📌 Overview
This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behaviors and attributes using unsupervised machine learning techniques. Customer segmentation helps businesses tailor marketing strategies, improve customer service, and increase overall revenue by understanding different customer needs and preferences.

🎯 Objectives
Understand customer demographics and behavior.

Group similar customers together using clustering algorithms.

Visualize and interpret the customer segments for actionable insights.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used contains information about customers, including:

Demographic features (e.g., gender, age)

Service usage (e.g., Internet service, contract type)

Account details (e.g., Monthly charges, tenure)

Target variable: Not used (unsupervised learning)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

scikit-learn for preprocessing and clustering (KMeans)

StandardScaler for feature scaling

PCA for dimensionality reduction (optional)

📈 Approach
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Converted categorical data using one-hot encoding

Scaled numerical features

Modeling

Used KMeans Clustering to segment customers

Determined optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method

Applied PCA for 2D visualization

Evaluation & Visualization

Plotted clusters to interpret group characteristics

Analyzed patterns in each segment

📌 Results
Identified distinct customer segments based on usage and account behavior.

Provided business insights to target each segment with tailored offers.
